# Main Differences Between ESP32 and ESP8266

What are the main differences between ESP32 and ESP8266 boards?

The ESP32 adds an extra CPU core, faster Wi-Fi, more GPIOs, and supports Bluetooth 4.2 and Bluetooth low energy. Additionally, the ESP32 comes with touch-sensitive pins that can be used to wake up the ESP32 from deep sleep, and built-in hall effect sensor.

Both boards are cheap, but the ESP32 costs slightly more. While the ESP32 can cost around $6 to $12, the ESP8266 can cost $4 to $6 (but it really depends on where you get them and what model you’re buying).

So, in summary:

The ESP32 is faster than the ESP8266;
The ESP32 comes with more GPIOs with multiple functions;
The ESP32 supports analog measurements on 18 channels (analog-enabled pins) versus just one 10-bit ADC pin on the ESP8266;
The ESP32 supports Bluetooth while the ESP8266 doesn’t;
The ESP32 is dual-core (most models), and the ESP8266 is single core;
The ESP32 is a bit more expensive than the ESP8266.
