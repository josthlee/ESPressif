The ESP12E and ESP12F are two variants of the popular ESP8266 WiFi-enabled microcontroller. There have been several variants of the board manufactured by different companies, each with different features. In this article, we will take a look at the differences between ESP12E and ESP12F.

<b>The ESP12F is a newer and more updated version of the ESP12E and features a better antenna design, hence the better output power.</b>
